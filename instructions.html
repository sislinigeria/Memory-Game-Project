    <p><strong>What is Memory Game? </strong> Also know as Concentration, Match Match, Match Up, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.</p>
